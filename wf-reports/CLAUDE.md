# Wireframe – Reports Comparison Feature

## File map

| File | Role | Read when |
|------|------|-----------|
| `index.html` | View — HTML structure + CSS | changing layout or styles |
| `data.js` | Model — static config + mock data + pure functions | changing data shape, presets, column defs, date math |
| `logic.js` | Controller — app state + all event handlers + rendering | changing any behaviour or UI output |

Load order matters: `data.js` must execute before `logic.js` (both are `<script src>` tags at the bottom of `index.html`). All symbols are globals.

## Key wiring

- **One period, three reports.** All three reports read the same production: `SHIFT_BLOCKS` is one mock week, and `blocksForRange` repeats it day by day over whatever range is picked (no production on future days). OEE and Quantities roll the blocks up; Downtime reads stop events that `downtimeEvents` allocates from each block's real downtime (planned − run), so Downtime minutes equal what OEE's availability implies. The comparison period is `SHIFT_BLOCKS_CMP` (fixed per-block factors). **Nothing is random** — the only variety is a stable hash — so every view, axis, split and report reconciles, and switching never changes a number.
- **Date / compare / filter change** → `redrawChart(currentXAxis)` (or `drawOeeChart` / `drawQtyChart`) → `downtimeBase()` rebuilds the events from the filtered period → `getAxisData(xAxis, base)` → `drawChartWith(items)` + `initTable(items)`. Nothing is cached between draws.
- **Downtime rows** come from `dtFinishRow`: average = duration ÷ count, % of planned = duration ÷ the row's planned time, people columns via `descrValues` (the same as OEE / Quantities). The **Total row** is `downtimeTotalRow` — the whole period, never a sum of rows (rows overlap on the people axes). **Split by** is `downtimeSplitMatrix`, a true two-way sum.
- **People attribution is the same in all three reports**: a stop / a block counts for everyone on the shift, so rows overlap on Operators and Operator groups, and sum exactly on Shift leaders (which has an `Unknown` bucket, per spec).
- **Picker snapshot** — `toggleDatePicker()` saves all state to `_pickerSnapshot`; `closeDatePicker()` restores it. `applyDatePicker()` clears it (commit).
- **`_appliedCompareOn`** tracks the last *applied* compare state (not the in-picker state). Compare events only exist while it is on.
- **Prototype settings** — the page brings its own H-key panel options (`window.PROTO_PANEL` in `index.html`, rendered by `../prototype/proto-panel.js`). `protoAwCount`: the Operators column shows "Additional workforce: N", N = the additional-workforce headcount summed over the row's shifts (what its man-hours were calculated from).

## Three reports: Downtime · OEE · Quantities

`currentReport` ('downtime' | 'oee' | 'quantities') drives `switchReport(type)`, which toggles the three `*-chart-section` blocks and calls the right `draw*` function. The left rail buttons (`rnav-downtime` / `rnav-oee` / `rnav-quantities`) call it. The four filter/date apply paths (`applyDatePicker`, `removeCompare`, `applyCdd`, `applyOperatorFilters`) each redraw whichever report is active.

### Shared people-data model (the important part)

OEE and Quantities both derive **everything about operators / groups / leaders from `SHIFT_BLOCKS`** in `data.js` — one block = a station-shift with a `leaderId`, `operatorIds`, and raw counters (`plannedMin/runMin/idealQty/totalQty/goodQty`). So chart, table, and filter chips always reconcile, and Split-by works on either dimension for free.

- **Name sync:** `OPERATOR_DIRECTORY` mirrors the setup prototype's 8 operators (`mock-data.js` MOCK_OPERATORS) in short form — `V. Mavroeidis`, `N. Papadopoulos` (the two `canLead`), `M. Kostopoulou`, etc., all in the single **`Operators`** group. Moving setup → reports shows familiar names. 1:1 by last name.
- **Pseudo-operators** — `Unknown` (`OP_UNKNOWN`) and `Additional workforce` (`OP_AW`) behave like operators everywhere: filter list, X-axis/split-by categories, table rows, `operators` descr column. They are NOT in `OPERATOR_DIRECTORY`; `allOperatorOptions()` pins them above the real people (Unknown → AW → operators A–Z) and the filter list renders them ungrouped above the group headers (`pinned()` in `FILTER_DIMS`).
  - A block belongs to **AW** when `awCount > 0` (even if it also has named operators) and to **Unknown** whenever it carries no named operator — an AW-only shift reports as both, per spec ("when only add. workforce is chosen, Unknown is also displayed, since no actual operator was selected"). See `blockPseudoOps` / `blockOperatorValues`.
  - **Man-hours:** AW = `awCount × plannedMin/60` per block (`awManhours`); Unknown = 0 — in all three reports, since Downtime reads the same blocks.
  - **Reconciliation:** every people axis sums to its Total. AW/Unknown have no group, so the group axis gets its own `Unknown` + `Additional workforce` buckets; the leader axis gets `Unknown` (`OP_NO_LEADER`, an alias of `OP_UNKNOWN`, also pinned in the Shift-leaders filter) for unled blocks.
- **`OEE_DIMS`** {operator, group, leader} maps a block → its value(s) per dimension. `oeeDimKey(label)` turns an axis/split label into a key. `oeeMatrixFromBlocks` / `qtyMatrixFromBlocks` build the outer×inner cell grid.
- **`selectedBlocks()`** applies the operator + leader filter chips to `SHIFT_BLOCKS`.
- **Axes map** — `splitOptionsFor(xAxis)` builds all three Split-by dropdowns and leaves out the dimension already on the X-axis: the spec's matrix has no diagonal (Operators × Operators and so on are "-"). `selectXAxis` / `selectOeeXAxis` / `selectQtyXAxis` drop the split when the axis moves onto it.

### OEE report

- `drawOeeChart()` dispatches: **line** only when `oeeChartType==='line'` AND `oeeXAxis==='Day'` AND no split (`oeeDailySeries` — rolled up from the same blocks as the Day table shown under it); otherwise **`drawOeeBars()`** (grouped bars). The 4 component bars are Quality/Performance/Availability/OEE (multiplicative — never stacked). **Manhours is table-only** — no 2nd-Y line.
- Controls: `oee-charttype-btn` (Line/Bar), `oee-xaxis-btn`, `oee-splitby-btn`.
- Tables: `renderOeeMainTable` (full 21-col `OEE_TABLE_COLS`, no-split) / `renderOeeTable` (compact category×inner, split). `oeeTableRows(blocks, dimKey)` builds rows + a Total.

### Quantities report

- `drawQtyChart()` — **stacked** bars (Scrap+Good+Potential = ideal output; opposite of OEE's multiplicative components). Per block: Good=`goodQty`, Scrap=`totalQty−goodQty`, Potential=`idealQty−totalQty`. `QTY_SEGMENTS` defines the colors (grey/green/orange). Day axis = `qtyByDay`; categorical = `qtyMatrixFromBlocks`.
- Controls: `qty-xaxis-btn`, `qty-splitby-btn` (Y-axis fixed to Quantity). State: `qtyXAxis`, `qtySplitBy`, `_qtyHidden`, `_qtyPage`.
- Tables: `renderQtyTable` (full, `QTY_TABLE_COLS`) / `renderQtySplitTable` (compact). `qtyTableRows(blocks, dimKey)`.
